Such a problem occurs intrinsically e.g. in the field of radio astronomy but also in magnetic resonance imaging (which - mathematically - are closely related), but also simply non-uniformly taken measured values require an appropriate procedure. A solution to this problem lies in the use of so-called gridding operations.\n",

This lecture can also be supplemented to the lecture [Medical Image Processing](https://graphics.cs.tu-dortmund.de/lehre/lehrveranstaltungen/ws-2020/2021/medizinische-bildverarbeitung).
